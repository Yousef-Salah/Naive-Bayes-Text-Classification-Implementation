## Naive Bayes Text Classification Implementation

On this project, I aimed to simulate Naive Bayes Classification algorithm by utilizing python & pandas, and the main implementation code is on [implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/Yousef-Salah/Naive-Bayes-Text-Classification-Implementation/blob/main/implementation.ipynb).

Unfortunately, I did not get high performance because it is just a starting and I just compare depending on similarity.
